Sewts coding challenge:

For our new project we need a python script with the following criteria
 - A user can input the name of a class
 - At least one class corresponding to the name
 - The run method of the corresponding class is called
 - There should be unittests for the script and the run method

Hint: for the run method it is enough to add simple code in it (like printing the name of the class)
