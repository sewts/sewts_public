# Story 1:

## Description:

We need a new command line script for our awesome new feature.

The script should be able to accept a name value as parameter which will be used internally.
Also we need an internal mapping of the given name to our implemenation classes (they are not there yet), so we can 
execute the "run" method of the class we selected with the name.

## Acceptance Criteria:
- UnitTests with PyTest
- Running without errors
- More than 1 class implemented
- Any additional requirements added to the requirements.txt

# Hints:
- For the run method it is enough to print the name of the class and the current time
