# Story 1:

## Description:

We need a new command line script for our awesome new feature.

The script should be able to accept a name as parameter which we will use for the following functionality.
Also we need an internal mapping of the given name to our implementation of internal classes (they are not there yet).
The script should call a "run" method of the class of the same name that was entered by the user.
The run method in this first step can do anything (e.g. print out the name of the class)

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Running without errors
- At least two classes implemented
- UnitTests with PyTest implemented
- Any additional requirements added to the requirements.txt

# Hints:
- For the run method it is enough to print the name of the class and the current time
